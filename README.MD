# PARTNERZ - Social app

This project was completed in 4 days by our group of 3: Sam Sinz, Olympe Lespagnon and Justine Sarzi. We succeeded to deploy the platform even if we wished to have more time to implement more features. We are really proud of this project because what started as a school project turned into a potential business idea.

Partnerz is currently a web app but we hope to turn it into a native app in the future.

Partnerz is not a dating/meeting app! It is more than that. Users choose 2 to 5 tags (ex: 'Drinks', 'Original'..) and are shown different choices of activities depending on their interests. They can select the activity they would like to do and find a partner to do it with. The other user receives a hang out request and has the possibility to accept or decline their invitation. Finally, they can both discuss to decide when and where to meet and fully live the Partnerz experience!

## About the implementation

We did the following:

- 5 relational data models: User / Activity / Match / Message / Discussion
- Handle account creation
- Handle profile changes and update database (profile picture, bio, and tags)
- Matching a user with an activity (depending on the number of tags they have in common) 
- Sending a request
- Accepting or declining an invitation
- Starting a conversation
- Having access to all hang out requests
- A database on Mongoose Atlas 
- Deployment on Render 


## Possible improvements

- Deploy as an actual App
- Implement notifications when the user gets a request or message
- Add real-time messages with timestamps
- Increase our database
- Turn Partnerz into a real bussiness
